# Paradox Defense

This is a game made at Code Day Bellevue, a 24-hour hackathon/game-jam on 2020-02-22.

it is intended to be a "4D" tower defense game, meaning you can place towers back in time and it changes the current state of everything to be as if you placed that tower at the specified time.

for the time being, the 1, 2, and 3 keys are for placing gatling, laser, and time towers respectively. space spawns more enemies. left click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom. left and right arrow keys should change the time at which you are placing a tower?
